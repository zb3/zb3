### Hi there

Okay. So I've created zb3/zb3 and I can now add this text to my profile. You can do this too, hopefully you'll make a better use of this feature...

Anyway, here's a giraffe: ğŸ¦’

and here's the link to my Gist profile, cool stuff there:   
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <td>ğŸ™‚
      <td align="center">ğŸ‘‡
      <td>ğŸ™‚
    </tr>
   </thead>
   <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>ğŸ‘‰
      <td><a href="https://gist.github.com/zb3">zb3's gists</a>
      <td>ğŸ‘ˆ
    </tr>
  </tbody>
  <tfoot>
    <tr>
      <td>ğŸ™ƒ
      <td align="center">ğŸ‘†
      <td>ğŸ™ƒ
    </tr>
  </tfoot>
</table>
